I think it's interesting that one thing that hackers truly value is living in a society where there is equal access to the share of information. In SF, there is no equal access to opportunities or living arrangements. Facebook, which has a sign on its campus that says "The Hacker Company" seeks to epitomize this. I find it ironic because it is also a company in the Bay Area that has contributed to the hyper gentrification of San Francisco's neighborhoods. While it seeks to be all inclusive of different ethnic background and gender identities, in doing so it is hyper disclusive to class. The entire campus is very opulent and it would be difficult to be an employee there and not have a sense of entitlement to all the company perks money can buy.
