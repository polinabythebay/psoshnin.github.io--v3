I'm Polina and this is my blog. I like to post about topics I'm interested in and hacks I've done. The title of my blog is inspired from an amusing [TED talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/jonathan_zittrain_the_web_is_a_random_act_of_kindness) on how the internet works.

If you'd like to get in touch: me [at] polina [dot] io.

Spring 2014: I'm doing an independent study where I'm teaching myself Rails. You can follow that project by looking at the "Polina on Rails" posts. :)
