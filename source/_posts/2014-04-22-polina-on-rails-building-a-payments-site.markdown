Why is this topic interesting:

Global digital currencies such as Bitcoin are disrupting online commerce and I am predicting that the landscape of digital payments is going to undergo a lot of change in the next decade. A huge portion of the internet is used to pass bits back and forth that represent money in some form and I think it would be really interesting to research what goes on behind the scenes when I buy something online and implement that in my own app. 

Why Ruby on Rails and Stripe:

Stripe API is easy to use, well documented, has clear cut pricing, integrates easily into Rails applications, and is arguably the most straightforward way to learn how to handle online payments. 

What I will be doing:

I will be making a Ruby on Rails web application that I will host on Heroku and use the Stripe API to process credit card payments. I want to use this app to sell off most of my belongings that I’ve acquired while in college: books, futon, dorm furniture, clothes, etc. I’ll offer visitors an option to pay me in person (via cash/check) or via Stripe/creditcards. Ideally I want to have my site up on a computer with my poster so people can browse my site while I talk about my poster. 

02/09/14 Update: I just came back from a conference and they gave us complimentary Square readers. In keeping with the theme of my poster I may incorporate Square on my tablet if I have time. 

Building the site:

Security and PCI Compliance
Custom Payment Forms
State and History
Handling Webhooks
Processing Payments with Background Workers
Subscriptions
Marketplaces
