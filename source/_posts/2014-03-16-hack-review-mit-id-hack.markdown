This was my first ever hackathon, so it's special to me for that very reason. Called the MIT International Development Hackathon, it was help February something, 2013. 

Date: February

Location: Cambridge, MA

####Number attended: ~100

####What I worked on: 
An public health windows 8 app that addresses hospital readmission rates in countries where villages are geographically sparse and doctors are in short supply. (see link here). We won an xbox and then submitted our app to the Microsoft Imagine Cup for the hell of it. Made it to top 25, which isn't bad for a weekend hack (+ 1 spring break's worth of coding). It is no longer an active project. 

####Who can attend? 
Students in the Boston area, (graduate and undergradate). 

####Who does attend?
Students, about 80% guys. Some of the girls leave after the first day. 

####How much does the event cost? Is there travel reimbursement?
Free- paid <$10 for public transportation. Held at the NERD center, very awesome. 

####Format of hackathon?
No one comes in with an idea, no teams are formed prior to hack. People from sponsoring organizations/non-profits pitch ideas, people form teams around ideas. 

####Number of people on a team? How easy is it to form teams with new people? 
2-10 people per team. Really easy to forms teams and meet new people. I brainstormed, worked with, and finished a project with three guys I met for the first time that weekend. 
 
####How good are the facilities? How well is it organized?
A++. WONDERFUL FOOD. Really set the bar high for food at hacks. Wonderful internets, sleeping places. Microsoft mentors gave me a keyboard for free to take home as well as a mouse and let me use a Surface for the whole weekend to test my app. Really great experience. 

####Are there a lot of awesome mentors? 
Yes! Only Microsoft mentors, but they were awesome. 

####Are there a lot of awesome prizes?
Yes! Not $10K in prizes or anything but my team won an xbox!

####How long is the hackathon?
Friday-> Saturday night. So we did 1 allnighter. 

####Did the hackathon committee state the goal of the hackathon? Was their goal achieved? 
Yes, they stated a goal, and I believe the goal was achieved.
