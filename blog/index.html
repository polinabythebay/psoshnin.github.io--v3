<p>I think it&rsquo;s interesting that one thing that hackers truly value is living in a society where there is equal access to the share of information. In SF, there is no equal access to opportunities or living arrangements. Facebook, which has a sign on its campus that says &ldquo;The Hacker Company&rdquo; seeks to epitomize this. I find it ironic because it is also a company in the Bay Area that has contributed to the hyper gentrification of San Francisco&rsquo;s neighborhoods. While it seeks to be all inclusive of different ethnic background and gender identities, in doing so it is hyper disclusive to class. The entire campus is very opulent and it would be difficult to be an employee there and not have a sense of entitlement to all the company perks money can buy.</p>

			Installing Ruby and Rails</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Included file &lsquo;JB/setup&rsquo; not found in _includes directory</p>

<p>I was told that setting up my development environment for writing Rails apps was going to be one of the trickiest parts of my entire learning experience, and they were right. The process was convoluted enough that I&rsquo;m making a post out of it to use as a means for documenting the process should I need to redo it in the future.</p>

<p>The best list of instructions for installing the latest version of Rails (4.1) and Ruby (2.0) for Mac 10.9 Mavericks can be found <a href="http://railsapps.github.io/installing-rails.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>However, what Daniel failed to mention in his installation guide was that you <em>will</em> need to also install previous versions of Ruby (1.9.3) and Rails (3.2) in order to successfully complete some of his tutorials. It&rsquo;s also a good exercise in managing different versions of Ruby and Rails for different projects and understanding how RVM works.</p>

<p>So here&rsquo;s what you need to set up your Rails environment. I&rsquo;m going to assume you are using Mac OSX 10.9 Mavericks.</p>

<ul>
<li><h5>Xcode</h5>

<p>This is Apple&rsquo;s development environment. You would use this if you were creating apps for iOS or Mac. Xcode includes a few system libraries that you need for Rails development.</p></li>
<li><h5>Homebrew</h5>

<p>Homebrew is a package enviroment for OSX that is really good to have in general when installing packages. It will install most missing system packages that you&rsquo;ll need for Rails.</p></li>
<li><h5>RVM (Ruby Version Manager)</h5>

<p>If you&rsquo;re serious about learning Rails development, you will install RVM. It lets you manage different versions of Ruby, Rails, and Gems so you can try out new versions and use different production environments for different applications without having to install/reinstall everything.</p></li>
</ul>


<h5>Install XCode</h5>

<ul>
<li>Click and install XCode from the Mac Store (this is large&mdash; it could take awhile)</li>
<li>Once installed, go to Preferences &ndash;> Downloads &ndash;> Install Command line tools</li>
</ul>


<h5>Install Homebrew and apple-gcc42</h5>

<p>This will install the Homebrew package manager and a GCC compiler.</p>

<h5>Exploring RVM</h5>

<p>This is the structure of RVM. If you type <em>rvm list</em> into your terminal it will show you a list of available Ruby versions:</p>

<pre><code>$ rvm list
rvm rubies

=&gt; ruby-1.9.3-p484 [ x86_64 ]
   ruby-2.0.0-p353 [ x86_64 ]
 * ruby-2.1.0 [ x86_64 ]

# =&gt; - current
# =* - current &amp;&amp; default
#  * - default
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to switch between differeny versions of Ruby, type in <em>rvm use 2.0.0</em>:</p>

<pre><code>$ rvm use 2.0.0
Using /Users/psoshnin/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p353
</code></pre>

<p>Type in <em>rvm list</em> to see you&rsquo;ve switched branches:</p>

<pre><code>$ rvm list
rvm rubies

   ruby-1.9.3-p484 [ x86_64 ]
=&gt; ruby-2.0.0-p353 [ x86_64 ]
 * ruby-2.1.0 [ x86_64 ]

# =&gt; - current
# =* - current &amp;&amp; default
#  * - default
</code></pre>

<p>In addition to having different versions of Ruby you will also have different gemsets associated with your current Ruby version. Type in <em>rvm gemset list</em> to view a list of available gemsets for Ruby 2.0.0.</p>

<pre><code>$ rvm gemset list
gemsets for ruby-2.0.0-p353 (found in /Users/psoshnin/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p353)
=&gt;  (default)
    global
    rails-bootstrap
</code></pre>

<p>The arrow shows that my default gemset is active. You can see I&rsquo;ve created a <em>rails-bootstrap</em> gemset for a specific project. Use the command <em>rvm gemset use global</em> and <em>rvm gemset use default</em> to switch between gemsets.</p>

			Why I Am a Hacker</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Included file &lsquo;JB/setup&rsquo; not found in _includes directory</p>

<p>What are hackers like? Why are there so few women hackers?</p>

<p>Hackdom is an abstract, and at first a bit mysterious-seeming gateway to a whole world with an intricate logic of its own.</p>

<p>Hackers build things.</p>

<p>Hackers solve problems and build things, and they believe in freedom and voluntary mutual help.</p>

<p>The world is full of fascinating problems waiting to be solved. Hackers get a thrill from solving problems, sharpening their skills, and exercising their intelligence.</p>

<h3>What hackers believe</h3>

<p>Hackers hold the belief that even though you may not know all of what you need to solve a problem, if you tackle a piece of it and learn from that, you&rsquo;ll learn enough to solve the next piece.</p>

<p>No problem should ever have to be solved twice.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a moral duty for you to share information, solve problems, and then give solutions away just so other hackers can solve new problems instead of having to perpetually re-address old ones. Following that line of thought, hackers believe there shouldn&rsquo;t be legal, artificial technical, or institutional barriers to sharing information and solving problems.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s justified to use your hacking skills to support a family or even to get rich, but you don&rsquo;t forget your loyalty to your art and your fellow hackers while doing it.</p>

<h3>Freedom is good</h3>

<p>Hackers are naturally anti-authoritarian</p>

<p>If you revere competence, you&rsquo;ll enjoy developing it in yourself and the hard work and long hours and dedication will seem worth it.</p>

<p>Hackerdom is culture with no money economy &mdash; I find this interesting</p>

<p>It runs on reputation. You can &ldquo;earn&rdquo; reputation bagdes through sites like StackOverFlow or HackerRank or by just getting known in the community through contributions on GitHub and the like. In doing so you try to solve interesting problems but ego or external validation aren&rsquo;t the goals here. You become respected by hackers by writing open source software that other hackers will think are fun and/or useful. Contributions work the same way: helping test and debug open source software will achieve similar goals. (This will also generate good karma :)</p>

<p>Hackerdom is a gift culture: you don&rsquo;t achieve status and reputation by dominating others, or being superficially beautiful, or making other people jealous. You achieve status by giving away your time, creativity, and skill.</p>

<p>Hackerdom doesn&rsquo;t have charismatic leaders&mdash; instead it has heroes and elders and historians.</p>

<p>How to fit into this culture?
Learn to write very well and understand how to effectively convey ideas. Understand how to exert mental discipline and a relaxed awareness of control &mdash; training in the martial arts is one way of doing this. I think many different types of disciplines can apply here.</p>

<h3>Skills to have</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s best to learn the hacker five: Python, C/C++, Java, Perl, Lisp. These are the most important hacking languages and they all represent different approached to programming and will educate you in different ways.</p>

<p>Learn C and Lisp (Scheme), then Java. C is very efficient of your machine&rsquo;s resources, but it requires you to do a lot of low-level management of memory by hand. Low level code tends to get complex and error prone. Python uses your machine&rsquo;s time less efficiently, but it uses your time more efficiently.</p>

<p>Perl is worth learning because it&rsquo;s widely used in web pages and sysadmin. A lot of people use Perl to avoid C programming.</p>

<p>Learning to program is like learning to write well in your natural language. The best way to do this is to read stuff written by the masters, write some things yourself, read a lot more, write a little more, until your code starts to look like the masters.</p>

<p>Get open-source Unix/Linux and learn how to use and run it. I feel like if you went the mac route and learned how to use linux/unix commands that would work as well.</p>

<p>Unix&mdash; operating system of the internet. You can&rsquo;t be a hacker without understanding unix.</p>
