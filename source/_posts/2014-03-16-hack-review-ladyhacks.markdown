The third hack I went to and the first all-women hack. There is a little bit of controversy over all-women tech events, so I decided to investigate the beasts themselves. 

Date: March something, 2014 (International Women's Day!)

Location: Philadelphia, PA

Number of people attended: 40

What I worked on:
A community editable guide to the awesome lady tech community! We basically ported an old Rails app and redid all of the outdated dependencies, redid the asset pipeline, configured it for Heroku, and did a little bit of UI restructuring. Still an active project! Check it out on github: 

Who can attend? Who does attend?
Women. Women. Lots of them. But that's not all-- their ages and skill level are all over the spectrum! I loved this. I was able to both be a mentor to newbies to Rails and get advanced Git help from a woman who's been an industry dev for a few years. I really loved this aspect. 

How much does the event cost? Is there travel reimbursement?
Event cost $10, which was donated to a non-profit. I technically went as a mentor, so I didn't have to pay for that. They assumed everyone was from Philly. 

Format of hackathon?

People brainstorm topics on Friday, any topic really, and then formed loose teams around those topics. 75% of topics focused on getting women more interested in technology. 

Number of people on a team? How easy is it to form teams with new people? 
Teams were 2-10ish people. 
 
How good are the facilities? How well is it organized?
It was a startup space, food was good (not amazing, but it was cul)

Are there a lot of awesome mentors? 

Are there a lot of awesome prizes?

How long is the hackathon?

Did the hackathon committee state the goal of the hackathon? Was their goal achieved?
