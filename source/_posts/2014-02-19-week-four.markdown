Next--> make a very simple subscription site with stripe and recurly

Authentication:

* adds a sign-in form that uses SimpleForm and Twitter Bootstrap

Authorization:
* adds the CanCan and Rolify gems to the Gemfile
* creates the CanCan Ability class
* configures CanCan exception handling
* sets up User roles with Rolify

User Managment:
* adds a name attribute to the User model

* provides custom views for registering and editing users

Stripe-specific fields:
* customer_id to store Stripe customer id
* last_4_digits to let customer know which cc they're using
