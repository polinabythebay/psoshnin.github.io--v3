This is the page where I will post about my coding projects, yay!

Rails app using Stripe API, Venmo API, Coinbase --> use it to sell my stuff

Open up a Bitcoin wallet and a Dogecoin wallet

Make a new octopress theme and give install instructions

Create a tiny static site generator using ruby (I'm gonna name it Diego)

Make an iOS app, android app using Parse

Contribute to bundler, open source project
