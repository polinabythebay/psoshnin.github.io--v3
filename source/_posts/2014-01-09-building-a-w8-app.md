A three part series in which I talk about my experience developing in the three mobile ecosystems: iOS, Android, and W8. 

One huge problem with Client-Side systems going into 2014 is that to reach all users, your app must be built three times: in Android (Java), iOS (ObjC), and Windows 8(C#). 

Since I will probably have to come across these three ecosystems at one point in my career, I figured I'd give all of them a go. 

This is a post in which I talk about my experience making W8 apps and why I will probably never want to do it in real life.
