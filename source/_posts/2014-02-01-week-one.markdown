Hello and welcome to my blog! I'm designing an independent study this semester so I can devote time to learning the ins and outs of Rails. I'm using Octopress, a blogging framework built for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) which is a static site generator that uses Github [pages](http://pages.github.com/). If you're interested in seeing how I set up this blog, see setting up [Octopress](http://octopress.org/docs/setup/). You can also checkout my source code [here](https://github.com/psoshnin/psoshnin.github.io/tree/source) if you want to see how I customized my blog.

To see what fun things I'm going to be up to, go to the [Syllabus](http://polina.io/syllabus/) tab. 

To see what fun projects I'll be working on, I will be designating all of my Github repos with the following naming convention: cs350-week-number-projectname. I'll also be posting notable ones in the [Code](http://polina.io/code/) tab. 

I'm currently based in Boston, so if you're also really excited about learning Rails and want to meet up/learn more feel free to get in touch: me[at]polina[dot]io.
