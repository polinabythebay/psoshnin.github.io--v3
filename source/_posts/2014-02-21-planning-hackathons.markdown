A discussion on hackathon planning and how to cater the traditional hack model to those who don't identify with the traditional "hacker" profile. 

Review what should go into a hackathon, and what shouldn't. What is the goal of a hackathon? Numbers? Sponsorship? Prizes? Number of newcomers to the hacking scene?

Who can attend? Who does attend?

How much does the event cost? Is there travel reimbursement?

Format of hackathon?

Number of people on a team? How easy is it to form teams with new people? 
 
How good are the facilities? How well is it organized?

Are there a lot of awesome mentors? 

Are there a lot of awesome prizes?

How long is the hackathon?

Did the hackathon committee state the goal of the hackathon? Was their goal achieved? 

I don't consider myself a classical hacker by any means, but I love going to hackathons and I want to identify what works, what doesn't work, and what can make them better. I'm doing a series on "yelp style" reviews for hacks I attend. Hackathons are places to consume new ways to thinking, using tools, and collaborating. Based on effort I put in (namely time+travel expenses+lack of sleep) I generally feel that I get a lot of really awesome things out of hackathons. I go mainly for the experience to learn something new, share my knowledge with new friends, and participate in the tech community. Because I don't mainly go for the awesome prizes I like to think of myself as a hackathon foodie, if you will.
