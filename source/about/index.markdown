I'm Polina and this is my blog-in-progress. The title of my blog is inspired from an amusing [TED talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/jonathan_zittrain_the_web_is_a_random_act_of_kindness) on how the internet works.

* Interests & Topics to explore: 

	* currency <--> data <--> value 
	* Improve the quality and usability of information on the Web. Particularly in the following areas: city, gov, education, healthcare.
	* Truly democratize tech: give everyone, regardless of gender, race, nationality, or socioeconomic background, the encouragement and resources to learn & understand how today's technology works and empower them to use it in new creative ways.
	* Rethink traditional payment systems.
	* API design and implementation
	* cryptocurrencies
	* Project Loon
	* Raspberry Pi
